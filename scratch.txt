TODO List-------
* Utilize custom GTR protein exchangabilities (simulation/main.py or evolve.py)
* Add estimated max gap dist (extract_params.py and modelfit.py)
* source code broken for deletions and insertion distributions (indel-seq-gen)
* Historian and baliphy to use same substitution/indel model
* Fixed number of iterations vs. until convergence
* Colless index in model (+ in tree_gen_nni and seq characterization)
* Historian/Baliphy parallelization
* Sample run


Metrics -----
* SP, TC (alignments)
* RF, RFL (trees)
* Convergence (ESS, MCT)
* Parameter Accuracy

Experiment 1: 15 sequences / category (3 total): mamX_10k, mam21_10k, etc. etc.
* Constants: Fixed number of iterations, same substitution/indel models
* DV: SP, TC, RF, RFL, Convergence, Wall-clock, parameter Accuracy

Experiment 2: 5 sequences / category (3 total): 
* Constants: Convergence metric boundary, same substitution/indel models
* DV: SP, TC, RF, RFL, Wall-clock, parameter Accuracy

Points to hit about program ----
* Creation of a "topological" consensus tree
* Multivariate distribution and sampling
* Guide tree generation
* Indel-seq-gen (custom protein gtr matrix, generating indel distribution... issues with that)
* RFL scores 
* Mixing statistics... ESS, MCT, ASDSF

Questions -----
* Controlled number of iterations?... how do they work with historian?
* Which datasets would be best? (mamillian X chromosomes from orthoDB and more?)
* Same substitution/indel models for baliphy and historian?
* "new best log likelihood", trace files for historian 
* Historian speed and how iterations/sequence works
* Memory errors

behavior per iter and second
* no sampling parameters
